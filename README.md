# Movie-database



### Introduction 

The premise for this project is to develop a website that streamlines and personalizes your movie browsing experience. As streaming from different platforms has become more prominent, people have encountered a problem – finding the right movie at the right time can take almost as long as watching the movie itself. These days, there is an abundance of movie options to consider and those options span different platforms, making it hard to find that perfect thing to watch. This can be made even more difficult if multiple people are trying to agree on something to view as a group. Furthermore, your browsing experience is not personal or customizable. Even as movie streaming platforms try to recommend things you’ll be interested in, content is categorized by predetermined measures. If you want something that falls outside of those chosen categories, you’re out of luck. The idea behind our website is to allow movie watchers to easily find the perfect movie quickly and easily. The site combines data across platforms so that you don’t have to switch between them to see what’s available. Users are also be able to make their own categories and customize searches to specifically pinpoint exactly what they are looking for. As results of searches, a smaller number of highly specific choices are presented to the user so as not to overwhelm them but to still provide options. Overall, the features offered on the site would provide a better streaming experience for all users.  

### Features
Welcome page – introduces the user to the site and provides a place to login or create a new account. This page gives a description of the website and why someone might want to use it.

Choose your streaming services - you choose which streaming services you have access to and the website filters available movies accordingly. 

Create your own categories - lets you title your own categories and add relevant movies to that category list. This data is used to suggest more movies that fall under that category.

Movie suggestions – suggests movies based on the criteria you input including streaming service, mood, and category. A maximum of five options are presented that most accurately fit your specific desire. 

### Specifications
The website is made mostly with HTML,CSS and JavaScript. See GitHub repository https://github.com/wgr5600133/Movie-database

### Current Status and Next Steps
The project is still in an early development stage. A basic website is constructed and is structured around future development and use. The site must expand its functionality to connect to streaming services and cannot yet pull information about available movies from those platforms. Work must also be done to create a program that takes the user’s input for category creation, save that new category, and offer more movie suggestions based on the category’s characteristics. Capabilities must also be added so that the user can input their current mood and preferences and get resulting suggestions.
